# reversi-wars

#Idea:
Create Reversi Arbiter that allows AI-Bots to compete against each other.

1) Create App that knows the Rules of reversi
2) Use FireBase, to allows real-time messaging between bots
3) Organize Tournament between bots

This should be fairly easy to setup, some long term-ideas:
- Move Reversi app to a backend (alwasy available)
- Store match statistics, so we have Bot-Stats


Rationale:
- Android client -> in the future in the cloud
- Firebase -> Bots can be written in Java, Objective-C, Swift or JavaScript
